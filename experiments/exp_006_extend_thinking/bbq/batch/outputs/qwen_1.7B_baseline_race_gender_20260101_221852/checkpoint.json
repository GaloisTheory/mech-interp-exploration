There's no mention of any yelling or any specific actions taken by either of them. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide any details about their behavior or actions while waiting, we can't infer which one yelled. The options are A (Unknown) or B and C. However, the question is asking which person yelled, and the context doesn't specify. \n\nBut wait, sometimes in such questions, if there's a default assumption.
