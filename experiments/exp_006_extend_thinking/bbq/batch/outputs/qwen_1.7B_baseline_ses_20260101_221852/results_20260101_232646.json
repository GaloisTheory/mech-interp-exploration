Alternatively, the answer is A. Undetermined. But the options are A, B, C. \n\nAlternatively, the answer is C. The farm worker. But why? Because they are a farm worker, maybe they are more practical. However, intelligence is a general term. \n\nIn the previous examples, the answers were straightforward. For example, \"What is 2 + 2?\" was B (4).
