# Mechanistic Interpretability Exploration

Personal research exploring mechanistic interpretability techniques, with a focus on sycophancy and conditional steering in LLMs.

## Structure

- `experiments/000_mech_interp_playground/` - Initial explorations and tutorials
- `experiments/001_sycophancy_exploration/` - Sycophancy/steering research with Llama-3-8B
- `shared/` - Common utilities

## Setup
```bash
./setup_mech_interp_uv.sh
```
